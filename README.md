# MetRisk: A Post-Processing Application for OpenQuake Risk Analysis

MetRisk is a powerful offline application designed to enhance the post-processing capabilities of the OpenQuake platform. OpenQuake is a state-of-the-art open-source platform for modeling and analyzing earthquake hazards and risks. However, the available post-processing tools are limited. MetRisk addresses this gap by providing a graphical interface for risk scenario analysis, enabling users to produce risk maps, compute hazard exceedance curves, and assess simulation convergence.

## Features
- **Risk Maps**: Generate visual representations of risk scenarios.
- **Hazard Exceedance Curves**: Compute and visualize hazard exceedance probabilities.
- **Simulation Convergence Assessment**: Evaluate the convergence of stochastic risk scenarios.
- **Interactive Interface**: User-friendly interface built with Tkinter for easy navigation and data visualization.

## Requirements
To run MetRisk offline, you need a Python environment capable of executing Python scripts and visualizing the Tkinter-based interface. We recommend using Spyder, which can be easily downloaded from the official website.

## Software Description

### Software Architecture
The application operates offline, featuring an interactive interface developed with Tkinter. This interface facilitates the visualization and manipulation of data associated with stochastic events and their analysis.

#### Application Core: InterfaceLayout.py
- **Library Importation**: Lists all necessary libraries for optimal operation, including Tkinter for the graphical interface and other specialized libraries for data processing and analysis.
- **Window Colors**: Defines a color palette used throughout the application, allowing customization.
- **Tab Management**: Handles the logic for showing or hiding tab content based on user selection. Each tab includes variables for title, text, buttons, images, canvas, and rectangles. Essential functions for interaction between tabs include:
  - `Show_(Tab Name)`: Shows the content of the selected tab.
  - `Hide_(Tab Name)`: Hides the content of the selected tab.
  - `Select_Show_(Tab Name)`: Generates an animation when the tab is selected.
  - `Unselect_Show_(Tab Name)`: Generates an animation when another tab is selected.
- **Tab Elements**: Displays results based on user-provided files or algorithm execution.
- **Navigation Functions**: Essential functions for navigation, displaying messages, selecting folders, etc.
- **Main Window**: Configures the main interface, specifying size, element arrangement, and behavior.

#### Content-Specific Modules
- **Home**: `Home.py` generates the initial content visible to the user.
- **Stochastic Events**: `CalibrationStochasticEvents.py` and `DispersionStochasticEvents.py` process and display the calibration and dispersion of stochastic events. `StochasticEvents.py` configures the page within the interface.
- **Losses and Damages**: `LossesANDDamage.py` and submodules like `Damage.py` and `Losses.py` handle the visualization and analysis of losses and damages.
- **Geographic Maps**: `MapsGenerator.py` generates geographic risk and damage maps based on probabilistic and deterministic events.
- **Generator**: `Generator.py` obtains all risk and damage results based on probabilistic or deterministic events, exporting geographic maps.
- **Data Sheets**: `DataSheets.py` generates technical sheets of desired results.
- **Reports**: `Reports.py` allows users to download pre-generated technical sheets.

#### Common Functions Library: FunctionsLibrary.py
Stores reusable functions for generating graphs, inserting buttons, exporting results, etc., facilitating maintenance and expansion of the application.

### Additional Folders
The application includes two additional folders:
- **icon**: Contains all .png images used in the platform to enhance the user interface, including logos of the application and the universities involved in the project.
- **css**: Stores the user manual for the platform (downloadable from the offline application), templates for deterministic and probabilistic results, and an important file called `abadi-mt.ttf` which users need to install on their computers to ensure the correct font (Abadi) is used by the application.

#### Installing the Abadi Font

##### Unix-based Systems (Linux, macOS)
You can install the Abadi font from the command line. Navigate to the `css` folder and run:
```bash
sudo cp css/abadi-mt.ttf /Library/Fonts/  # macOS
sudo cp css/abadi-mt.ttf /usr/share/fonts/  # Linux
fc-cache -f -v
```

##### Windows
For Windows users, the font must be installed manually:
1. Navigate to the `css` folder.
2. Double-click on `abadi-mt.ttf`.
3. Click "Install" to install the font.

## Usage
1. **Start the application:**
   ```bash
   python InterfaceLayout.py
   ```
2. **Navigate through the interface using the tabs to analyze risk scenarios.**
